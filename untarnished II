I have been asked:
Why is it that I believe myself to face such calamitious suffering? 
I do believe this to be quite a pertinent question, but I must first answer: 
Why is there suffering to begin with?
You see, with nothing causing nothing, there is nothing. 
However, with nothing beginning, it has been created the possibility of something. 
The possibility is what can be entertained conceptually. It can be displayed as well.
Whether or not this world of ours is purely conceptual or truly "real" is difficult to say, but it can be known for certain that its objects can be conceived of conceptually and cognitively. 
Nothing can only be nothing so long as it remains unbroken. 
As long as the block remains uncarved, its sections cannot be divided. 
It seems however, by whatever reason, that the plate of perfect being, which is pure nothingness, was shattered. 
Cracks formed in the plate and shards were scattered throughout the newly created reality. 
Concepts began to gain coherence, the world became knowable. 
Whether a true metaphysical rupture or a shared anthropogenic delusion, we have been able to speak of objects and even deduct from the world physical principles. 
It can be compared to the story of adam and chava, who were created as one perfect body, holding the entirety of the soul fragments of the world. 
When it was that they were split in half, and the perfect soul released into the imperfect souls of our world, the story of humanity began. 
Even further, it was then that they were to identify the animals and plants in the gan eden and distinguish them from each other. 
Upon eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which we can understand as the fruit of "conceptual demarcation", land was divisibile and place names were born; there was now inside and outside gan eden.
It came then, when the world and its phenomena could be discerned as having conceptual weight--good and evil, pleasure and pain, true and false--that suffering began.
