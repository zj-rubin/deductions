I happened upon the other day in a walk--or it may have been a dream--a particularly belligerent figure. 
I had meant no offense nor provacation, but it ended up that we were engaged in a conflict--the stakes of which were my entire empirical being.
See, my existence was intolerable to this figure from the beginning, so he was resolute in ending it. 
I will not bore you in the pettiness of the world and its awful reasonings. 
However, note that I fought back due to my conviction in the fundamental principle of semiotic completion, wherby things accord to their mediums. 
As a consequence of the principle, it must be my duty to return the peace of non-agression through fighting back to either victory or standstill. 
Otherwise, my easy death would only be taken as a victory of the violence of the agressor, and peace would be eternally ruptured through the understanding of the event. 
This is the foundation of culpability, is it not? Indeed, the murderer is not killing at the moment of prosecution nor conviction, but non-culpability would affirm only the falseness of the world. 
Regardless, that is not the point of this anecdote.
We were engaged in conflict over metaphysics, yet I must not have let my body been killed over a non-tangible issue. 
Yet, it came to the point in the discourse that was being exchanged over blows that I had to explain why it was that I must live at all, since the principle of completion would obviously be unsatisfactory due to heterogeneity.
Because of this, I had to produce an argument that would be acceptable to the person who was attempting to murder me. 
Note first that this figure was apathetic but perfectly logical. 
Note second that this figure was extremely comical but could not comprehend humor. 
Note third that this figure was violent but mercurial. 
Note fourth that this figure was rational but uneducated. 
Thusly, I needed to produce an argument justifying my existence to a figure who knew perfectly of arguments but not of their content, a figure who knew perfectly of violence but not of events.
This figure asked me:
"Your life is without worth and meaning. The dead do not care for events nor interpretations. Your entire experience is suffering. Yet, why do you struggle against the incoming hand of death?"
To which I responded:
"You see, I have been cursed with a most horrific burden. 
It has been decided that I am to suffer and be tortured infinitely, without reprieve. 
My death will not be my liberation, for it is instantly that I will be re-introduced to perfect suffering. 
It is not that I possess infinite lives, but rather that I exist infinitely--designed to suffer in every single one of those instances. 
It is not 'my' existence--that they are modeled after me--but rather that I embody a unique relation to the metaphysic which is likely doomed to be repeated in every version of the universe absent genuinely perfect deception. 
This is the ascent of my life, which I have in the past referred to as the avatƒÅra. 
Absent it, indeed, my life is worthless and I likely ought to end it myself.
However, I have refrained from suicide for a very particular reason, which is that I have a goal to see through. 
The shattering of value has always been exhaustingly apparant.
