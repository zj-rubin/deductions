I have said before:
"I have always regarded the melting of snow to be a catastrophe"
"The rains of spring fall in accordance with my tears"
It is the melting of snow and the subsequent spring mist that is the insignia of my anguish. 
However, it is the downpours of late spring that signal the true cruelty of my torture. 
So, I ask you:
When the downpour of spring comes, and you are without covering and without solace, will you continue to march forward? 
When the downpour of spring comes, and you are without your sight and without your touch, will you continue to bear life?
When the downpour of spring comes, and you are throttled by its cruel oppression, can you afford to call its bluff and affirm your suffering? 
When anguish pelts down like horrid rain, will you resist temptation and suicide? 
You see, the anguish of walking in the rain comes first from the worry over clothing. 
That is, the prospect of walking further while in the intolerable blight of wet clothing. 
A dreadful condition which may ruin their quality but more importantly violates their significance as the foundation of civilized society, which separates humanity from nature. 
Wet clothing is like an open stab wound, a fundamental terror against the promise of civilization. 
However, this aversion to wet clothing is the operating hand of the terror of the downpours. 
When one cares not for the state of clothing nor their interactions with the body, then one may walk through the pouring rain without fear or anguish.
It is purely attachment to the possession of clothing that issues in such fear. 
This is the reason for the creation of rain clothing, which somewhat mirrors the form of fashion but inscribes in it external purpose.
