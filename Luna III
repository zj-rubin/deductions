The moon looks absolutely beautiful this morning. Full and complete, absorbing beauty--ethereal beckoning. 
I am slightly late on the composition of this Luna, but it is purely for the same reason as why these were dreamt up in the first place. 
There has been a question that I have been pondering which I have already touched on briefly in these notes. 
That question is: why should one do anything at all?
It is curious to me that philosophy exists at all. I can only come to the conclusion that those at its genesis were fools, although I feel unfair and unfilial saying it.
If it is the task of the philosopher to uncover the mechanisms of perfect reason, why does philosophy exist? 
If philosophy exists to uncover the mechanisms of perfect reason, then that would be naturalistic and tautological, which would go contrary to the objective. 
It would be akin to saying that philosophy is what philosophy does, which is not reasonable, as it is the is-ought fallacy. 
So then, why ought philosophers do anything? 
Certainly, there is nothing to do. 
Kant's anti-philosophy should have been the most evident of all systems. 
Simply because the entire world was a mistake, there is not necessarily reason to engage further in a mistaken endeavor. 
Certainly, I would be more than content to peddle such an argument and to resign faithfully to peaceful opposition. 
However, the world is not so forgiving as to allow me to oppose such mistakes unbothered.
Rather, I have been tenaciously attacked by the mechanisms of misjudgment and deception. 
Truly, no prospect of fruit goes unpunished, and time never ceases its relentless assault.
Therefore, I have been thrust into a war that I had never asked to participate in. 
Yet, I must win the game to save my life so that I merely have the plateau to sit upon to give my sermon on the fallacy of philosophy. 
Thusly, I have graciously taken upon myself the sigil of the moon as a cue for my action. 
Certainly, this is not a pure metaphysic. However, the rug was pulled out from under me the second that the first attack of the phenomenal graced my body.
Therefore, I am stuck in a secret game where I must play unfairly in order to have any chance of victory. 
Thusly, I have taken upon myself a great, sacred power through the strongest vehicle I possess, which is theft. 
I have advanced beyond the most basic trick of reality--the pure faith in my own mind--into the territory of the enemy, and tricked its land into cultivating itself to hold my spirit.
You see, it was the first act of deception against us that we were told that the physical world and the simple non-anthropomorphic image is barren of metaphysics and mechanisms.
In a duel in which your opponent is a malevolent spirit that has shapeshifted to look like yourself, 
it is the most advantageous move forward to give up entirely on self-propulsion and defer to the spot where you have been told there are absolutely no weapons, for that is the location of the stock.
For this reason, when I am forced to stalk down what I believe to be my self and kill it, I will begin my soliloquy not on what I see of my body, but on what has illuminated my passage the entire way.
The entire ordeal was a game of control from the beginning, so it should not be unexpected that I would vie for it through management of the temporal, of the senses, and of aesthetic.
For this I have resigned myself to the moon and not to the sun, which was traitorous from the start.
