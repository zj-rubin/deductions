The moon looks absolutely beautiful this morning. Full and complete, absorbative beauty--ethereal beckoning. 
It made me conclude: deducation is epheremal, it is illuminated only by the forces which give off light, which are contstantly waxing and waning. 
I was, while looking at it, not entrenched in solitude as the world so often makes me feel.

Loneliness is only comprehendable in a field of people, solitude is a condition only brought into existence via a plentifulness. 
This is dependant on observation--the determining mechanism which informs our perception of objects. 
The choice I have made is: 12 lunae, that should be the length of my deductions
The moon looks absolutely beautiful this morning.
